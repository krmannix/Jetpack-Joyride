Jetpack-Joyride
===============

A clone of the popular mobile game "Jetpack Joyride", 
this version was designed in the Hardware Description Language (HDL) of Verilog, 
and was created using the Xilinx IDE. It follows the same basic principles of Jetpack Joyride, 
but is located in space. 
Avoid the flying blocks and continue on to achieve the high score (which is saved on an FPGA and needed to run the game).
