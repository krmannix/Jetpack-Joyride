Jetpack-Joyride
===============

A clone of the popular mobile game "Jetpack Joyride", 
this version was designed in the Hardware Description Language (HDL) of Verilog, 
and was created using the Xilinx IDE. It follows the same basic principles of Jetpack Joyride, 
but is located in space. 
Avoid the flying blocks and continue on to achieve the high score (which is saved on an FPGA and needed to run the game). To load this game, boot up an IDE used for Verilog (preferably Xilinx) and import the project parent folder - this should automatically assemble the project in your project tree within the IDE. Then, you must compile and deploy the project to an FPGA. 

Note: You may need to correlate the FPGA inputs for your specific model.
